With intuitive gesture controls, users can select colours and tools using two fingers, while a single finger serves as a brush for creating fun artwork. DigiArt combines the realms of artificial intelligence and artistic expression, providing a seamless and engaging platform for unleashing your creativity!

## How to Use:
* Hold your hand up in front of your camera to begin tracking.
* Use the index finger to interact with the virtual painter:
* **Selection Mode**: Point your index finger to the desired colour.
* **Drawing Mode**: Make a fist to switch to drawing mode. Move your finger to draw.
* **Eraser Mode**: Show your open palm to switch to eraser mode. Move your hand to erase.
* Your creations will appear on the canvas in real time.

## Tracking

Hand landmarks were tracked and their points are used to draw on the screen.
